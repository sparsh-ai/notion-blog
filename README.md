Medium.com is already there. Why this NotionBlog then?

I like medium a lot and for me, medium is the obvious choice for blogging. But there are certain extra features that I want for my blog and therefore created NotionBlog by simply wrapping an awesome project with GitHub Actions.

| | Medium | NotionBlog |
| - | -:| ---:|
| Toogles and other cool css features  | - | + |
| Google analytics data | - | + |
| Transfer (I use Notion for all my work, have to give extra time to convert notion pages to Medium) | - | + |
| Portability (I can transfer all my posts to html/markdown/pdf) with single click) | - | + |
| Like a website (We can make NotionBlog play the role of a basic website also) | - | + |
| Custom URL | - | + |

*Note*: All the remaining features like ad-monetisation, better google SEO etc. goes in the favor of Medium obviously.
